    <h1>Stay + Play</h1>

    <p>We recommend flying into Savannah, GA, but Hilton Head, SC also has a small airport you can fly into. Both are approximately a 30 minute drive to Palmetto Bluff.</p>

    <p>Palmetto Bluff is also only 15 minutes off of Highway 95.</p>

    <p>There are cottages and houses on the resort premises, which you can rent for the weekend. Cottages are Palmetto Bluff’s version of a hotel room with 1 bedroom, bathroom and screened porch overlooking the May River or lagoon while the houses are 2+bedrooms and have the full amenities of a house.</p>

    <p>We have room blocks at both the <a href="http://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/south-carolina/hampton-inn-and-suites-bluffton-sun-city-BFNSCHX/index.html">Hampton Inn</a> and <a href="http://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/bluffton/btosc/hoteldetail">Holiday Inn</a> and we will be providing trolley transportation to and from on Saturday for the wedding festivities. Room blocks are under <em>Byrnes Grayson Wedding</em>.</p>

    <p>While you’re in town for our wedding, enjoy yourself — make a tee time, go fishing, get a spa treatment, lay by the pool or take a boat ride over the sandbar!</p>
