    <p>We recommend flying into Savannah, GA or Hilton Head, SC. Both are approximately a 30 minute drive to Palmetto Bluff.</p>

    <p>Here are a couple local car/shuttle services that offer transport from the Savannah airport to Palmetto Bluff:</p>

    </ul>

    <p>There are three places we have reserved for our guests to stay during our wedding weekend:</p>
